FARM WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY
You don’t have to be from a farm to be a great farmer. Hay Day lets you get back to nature and experience the simple life of working the land. It’s a special game set in a real special place. Food grows free, people smile and the animals are always happy to see you. It never rains here, but the crops never die. And if you’re craving a little bacon, one of the pigs will be happy to fry some up for you. After all, what are pigs... oops, we mean neighbors for?
